# MileStone Project Two- Meg Mixology

An interactive fun front end website. I am designing a website that brings a little bit of my normal everyday
life into teaching other a few recipes and tricks. I am an assistant manager of a pub and it is my life so it's
time to share a bit of this in a fun way with the rest of the world. A website that will be kept up to date via 
the Cocktail DB API and bring a little lockdown joy to others.

* I contstantly was using chrome web developer tools, however when push to my mobile found these to not be the most
accurate. The design was though out to ensure smaller screens were not squished and legible throughout. Only one element
which is the clipboard "pop" art that does not appear on extra small. The layout of the other pages are slightly different
throughout each breakpoint on therapy and product page.

* Tested each page manually to ensure navigation and effects worked throughout and responded accordingly.

    - Safari
    - Google chrome
    - Mozilla Firefox

## Issues while Testing


## Deployment
My project was started on GitHub[github.com] by making a repositary and then using them with the GitPod IDE. I did the 
following steps in order to deploy my project.

1. From GitPod after the latest commit then we use GitPush to get the code in GitHub repositary.
2. Go to the required GitHub repositary and go to settings.
3. Scroll down to GitHub Pages section in settings
4. Where it says source choose master branch.
5. Then your site is published
6. The link is [https://megmog88.github.io/witch-doctor-welch/] to the live website.

## Clone or Download
1. When in the git hub repositary click on the green button "Clone or Download"
2. Copy the URL that is produced
3. Open your chosen IDE
4. Type in the workspace "git clone"
5. The paste the copied URL
6. Press enter
7. And you are complete :)
